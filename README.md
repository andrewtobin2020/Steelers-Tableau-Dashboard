# Steelers-Tableau-Dashboard
Project was designed to find insights into Ticket Holder Demographics (primarily age, gender, tenure), Club vs. Regular Season Ticket Holders, Satisfaction Ratings,
Comparisons between survey waves, and Recommendations to the organization for next season and/or additional questions to consider for future surveys. All insights were
put into a Tableau dashboard tha can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrew6940/viz/PittsburghSteelersProject/Preprocessing. Note: the dashboard
appears scrunched together, but expanding to full screen fixes the issue. Lastly, in the Excel file, 30 ticket holders (15 from each wave) were selected as people that the organization needed to reach out to. Reasons for doing so were provided.
